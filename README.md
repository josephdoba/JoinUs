## Setup:

### ``client/joinus_client``:

- run ``npm install`` to install dependencies.
- run ``npm start`` to launch server, then open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

### ``client/mobile``

- run ``npm install`` to install dependencies.
- run `sudo gem install cocoapods` ([Seen here](https://cocoapods.org/))
- For MacOS users, you will need the latest version of [XCode](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/xcode/id497799835?mt=12) installed. 

### ``/server``

- run ``npm install`` to install dependencies.
- run `npm run build` for the server folder to compile Typescript files.
- run ``npm run local`` to run the server with node-mon.


## Database Setup:

1. Create the `.env` by using `.env.example` as a reference: `cp .env.example .env`
2. Update the .env file with your correct local information

- username: `labber`
- password: `labber`
- database: `final`

3. Install dependencies: `npm i`
4. Add the schema and seed the database in pg

- Check the db folder to see what gets created and seeded in the SDB

5. Run the server: `npm run local`
   - Note: nodemon is used, so you should not have to restart your server

6. Visit `http://localhost:8080/`

## Warnings & Tips

- Split routes into their own resource-based file names, as demonstrated with `users.js` and `widgets.js`
- Split database schema (table definitions) and seeds (inserts) into separate files, one per table. See `db` folder for pre-populated examples.
